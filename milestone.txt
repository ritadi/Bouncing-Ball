week1:

implement score board to display the data and keep track of the game result.(DI SUN)

score board is consist of a 7-seg display, and take clock, resetn and lose signal as input, 
if resetn or lose signal is 1, then all register will be rest.

implement datapath to store the position of ball and paddle.(XUN LI)

need two register to store both position of ball and paddle, position of paddle is controlled
by player input, and position of ball is generated by its direction and speed.


week2:

try to finish the datapath if there are some errors or bugs.(XUN LI)
combine score board with datapath ensure it works(DI SUN)

implement FSM control to refresh the position of paddle and ball on the screen.(BOTH)

FSM will keep on its state unless resetn or lose.
if the ball hits the up-edge or the paddle, its direction will change.
if the ball hits the down-edge, lose signal will be 1.


week3:

implement the vga display.(Both)

generate the hs and vs by using tow counters. Display the ball and paddle on the screen.
combine FSM control with the datapath ensure it works(DI SUN)
combine all parts and debug on the board.
